# Bank-Network
Scenario
Recently there has been a change in the landscape of the local Halifax branch in Hatfield by adding a new floor to the main building. The computer network of the branch needs to be expanded too. The network designer has come with the topology in Figure 1.

As a new network engineer for this branch, you have been asked to assign the IP addresses and configure this small network for full connectivity.

You will need to configure the network according to Figure 1. The IP address is given to the network is 192.168.X.0 /24 where X will be a chosen number. To make sure that everything is tested properly before the implementation, an initial prototype will be built on Packet Tracer. You need to configure all the LAN and WAN interfaces on routers and PCs according to the IP subnetted addresses. When all PCs can ping their default gateways and each other from the old network to the new expansion, then the configuration is implemented correctly.
